# Genesis-Gir-Lessons-Volume-2
It's here the second installment of my workflows for all of you to research and dig threw and understand how to code way faster and more intuitive
programs to dig threw and understand! volume 2 is currently under development so sofware will be addded day by day or whenever they do I cannot stress enough how important it is to reference the automatetheboringstuff for these tutorials but some learning value can be found in them for sure! This repo has alot of useful information on getting started with python coding and contains alot of .py files to inspect and learn from! things get more complex than VOL.1 and it's free and open source.

- 10 .py files 
- Tutorials on python source code
- tips and tricks to use in your own code

# Learn, Explore, Study!
High value and love embedded into every code snippet any novice like me with-100 can see the workflows and why certain decisions were made and how they can implement them themselves in their own programs to enhance or develop  better coding or programming skills. Again these are just a progress board and nothing in these tutorials will set in stone that you will learn as fast as the next guy but it will make sure your on the right way to making your very own programs/software!
